# Runner Images - 2.3.0-preview

## Changes
These changes primarily renamed any references within the runner from 'actions' to 'environment operations'. For context, environment operations on an environment relate to any changes to the underlying resources within an environment, such as the deployment, deletion, and redeployment of an environment.
