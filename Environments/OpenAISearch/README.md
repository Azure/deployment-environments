# OpenAI Search
This template helps the developer quickly setup the infrastructure about OpenAI Search with enterprise own data for searching.

**Please note:** This template is just hosting the infrastructure. If the developer wants to deploy the application and prepare the data, please refer to the related [AZD repo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo). Typically, the developer can upload to app service by VS Code and upload the required test pdf files by executing the script "scripts/prepdocs.ps1"
